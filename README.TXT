# UNOFICIAL wiringPi
Modification of the original wiringPi library to work with 64bit operation systems.
Only tested on RPi3b, but in theory will work with any RPi that support the original wiringPi. 

**PLEASE** don't send bugs to the original author!

To not use root user to acces to gpio, I recommend to use the kernel of [sakaki](https://github.com/sakaki-/bcmrpi3-kernel)

Original Description
--------------------

wiringPi README
===============

Please note that the official way to get wiringPi is via git from
git.drogon.net and not GitHub.

ie.

  git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi

The version of wiringPi held on GitHub by "Gadgetoid" is used to build the
wiringPython, Ruby, Perl, etc. wrappers for these other languages. This
version may lag the official Drogon release.  Pull requests may not be
accepted to Github....

Please see

  http://wiringpi.com/

for the official documentation, etc. and the best way to submit bug reports, etc.
is by sending an email to projects@drogon.net

Thanks!
